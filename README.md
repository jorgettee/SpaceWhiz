INTRODUCTION

Background of the Study 

Nowadays, effective management of school facilities is crucial and essential to support students learning, Collaborations and productivity. One aspects of this management is the implementation of Room Reservation. The system offer a range of benefits that can process of booking room for classes and meetings to study and events. Ensuring the efficient use of space, enhancing accountability and flexibility. Room Reservation systems play a crucial role in optimizing resource allocation within educational institutions. 

A strategic approach involves exploring how room reservation systems can be integrated with practical applications. This aims to offer evidence-based recommendations for enhancing operational efficiency in school facilities while maximizing their potential. This research analyzes data on scheduling conflicts, underutilized spaces, and resource allocation patterns to suggest optimal solutions. Educators require valuable insights into the implementation process and its impact on educational settings. Therefore, this paper comprehensively examines these aspects before drawing conclusions on how policymakers or administrators involved in school decisions could improve their decision-making processes.

Significance of the Study

The study examines how room reservation systems can help educational institutions address issues related to space allocation and scheduling conflicts. By implementing these systems, schools can ensure fair access to facilities for all students, thereby enhancing their learning experiences. Furthermore, optimizing space utilization and may lead to cost savings by efficiently managing physical infrastructure.

* Policymakers

Utilize findings to enhance education efficiency with improved resource allocation and scheduling policies.

* Administrator

    Implement insights to streamline operations, reducing costs and effectively managing space.

* Teachers

    Access better facilities for enhanced lesson planning and student engagement.

* Students

    Imagine a more balanced resource distribution and optimized learning environments for academic success.
    
OBJECTIVES

The focal point of this system is to develop and implement a comprehensive system for enhancing student comfort and ensuring equitable access to quality educational facilities, thereby promoting inclusive and lifelong learning opportunities in the education sector.

* Home

    To have home features and the user can overview the building premises of the target location.

* Schedule

    To assist students and faculty in identifying which classrooms are presently being utilized.

* Reservation

    Its objective is to provide a feature that allows faculty to promptly reserve an available classroom if they need to use a specific facility within the building premises.

* Issue

   To readily identify any issues occurring in classrooms and  building within the campus's target location or premises.

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL (SDG)

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are crucial for addressing global challenges and fostering a more sustainable and equitable world. 

CORE VALUES

SDG 4: Quality Education

   This system can help the education industry especially on ensuring that the students have their comfort on the facilities that they will use for their study. This system can ensure the enclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities.   

RECOMMENDATIONS

In light of the findings, analysis and observation of the researchers on the proposed system, the following recommendations are proposed to address the identified challenges and improve operational efficiency within school facilities: 

*Automation

    Track booking patterns, keep updated on space usage, and pinpoint areas that need improvement with the help of data analytics and reporting. Future space allocation and planning can be influenced by these facts. 

*3D Design 

    Make 3D representations of the rooms and areas that are available so that users can virtually tour them before making a reservation. This is known as virtual room tours. This can assist users in seeing the area and assessing whether it suits their needs. 

*Room ID Sensor

    Room ID sensors offer real-time data on room occupancy, allowing administrators to monitor who is in a room and ensure only authorized access for safety and security. Access control systems maintain a log of entry and exit events with timestamps and user identities, creating an audit trail for investigating security incidents and verifying compliance.

*Decision Making

    Data-Driven Decisions: Make well-informed choices regarding room utilization, scheduling, and space allocation by utilizing real-time occupancy data and logs from room ID sensors and access control systems.
