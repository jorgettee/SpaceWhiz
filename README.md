# PROGRAM INTRODUCTION

SpaceWhiz is a versatile program designed for viewing room availability. With its intuitive interface, users can easily check which rooms are currently in use by accessing the schedule button. Need to reserve a room? The reservation button is just a click away. If a room has issues, users can flag it with a danger logo and leave a brief comment using the issue button. And when you want to see the big picture, simply hit the home button to view the overall room status. SpaceWhiz puts room management at your fingertips.

Background of the Program

Nowadays, effective management of school facilities is crucial and essential to support students learning, Collaborations and productivity. One aspects of this management is the implementation of Room Reservation. The system offer a range of benefits that can process of booking room for classes and meetings to study and events. Ensuring the efficient use of space, enhancing accountability and flexibility. Room Reservation systems play a crucial role in optimizing resource allocation within educational institutions. 

A strategic approach involves exploring how room reservation systems can be integrated with practical applications. This aims to offer evidence-based recommendations for enhancing operational efficiency in school facilities while maximizing their potential. This program focuses in analyzing data on scheduling conflicts, underutilized spaces, and resource allocation patterns to suggest optimal solutions. Educators require valuable insights into the implementation process and its impact on educational settings. Therefore, this program comprehensively examines these aspects before drawing conclusions on how policymakers or administrators involved in school decisions could improve their decision-making processes.

# Significance 

The program examines how room reservation systems can help educational institutions address issues related to space allocation and scheduling conflicts. By implementing these systems, schools can ensure fair access to facilities for all students, thereby enhancing their learning experiences. Furthermore, optimizing space utilization and may lead to cost savings by efficiently managing physical infrastructure.

* Policymakers

Utilize findings to enhance education efficiency with improved resource allocation and scheduling policies.

* Administrator

    Implement insights to streamline operations, reducing costs and effectively managing space.

* Teachers

    Access better facilities for enhanced lesson planning and student engagement.

* Students

    Imagine a more balanced resource distribution and optimized learning environments for academic success.
    
# Functions/Features

The focal point of this system is to develop and implement a comprehensive system for enhancing student comfort and ensuring equitable access to quality educational facilities, thereby promoting inclusive and lifelong learning opportunities in the education sector.

* Home Button

    To have home features and the user can overview the building premises of the target location.

* Schedule Button

    To assist students and faculty in identifying which classrooms are presently being utilized. With a click, displayed rooms can be set as "In Use".

* Reservation Button

    Allows faculty to promptly reserve an available classroom and set a time if they need to use a specific facility within the building premises.

* Issue Button

   Allows users to identify any issues occurring in classrooms and building premises through adding a warning icon with details inside.

# SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL (SDG)

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are crucial for addressing global challenges and fostering a more sustainable and equitable world. 

CORE VALUES

SDG 4: Quality Education

   This system can help the education industry especially on ensuring that the students have their comfort on the facilities that they will use for their study. This system can ensure the enclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities.   

# RECOMMENDATIONS

In light of the findings, analysis and observation of the researchers on the proposed system, the following recommendations are proposed to address the identified challenges and improve operational efficiency within school facilities: 

*Automation

Time automation can be implemented to mark rooms as unused after a certain period based on the user's schedule. This feature ensures efficient room allocation and prevents conflicts. For example, if a room is reserved from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM, the system can automatically mark the room as unused after 10:00 AM unless another reservation is made for that time slot.

*3D Design 

Make 3D representations of the building and areas that are available so that users can virtually view them before making a reservation. This can assist users in seeing the area and assessing whether it suits their needs. 

*Room ID Sensor

Room ID sensors offer real-time data on room occupancy,  allowing the program to automatically set the room as “In Use” when a professor enters a room. This can be done through microchips within the professor’s ID and a door sensor for future improvement. 

*Decision Making

A touch screen television can be used to show the program, a single touch can make the room “In use” and "Reserved" allow adding reservations easily and identify issues inside the room.
